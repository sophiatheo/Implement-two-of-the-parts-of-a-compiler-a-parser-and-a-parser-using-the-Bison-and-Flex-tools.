# Implement-two-of-the-parts-of-a-compiler-a-parser-and-a-parser-using-the-Bison-and-Flex-tools.

The exercise aimed to familiarize ourselves with the description of a language in BNF format, basic concepts of compilers and finally to implement two of the parts of a compiler, a parser and a lexical analyzer using the Bison and Flex tools. The language to be analyzed is a pseudo-language, which follows the logic of the C language.
